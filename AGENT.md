0 . Purpose & high-level picture
This repo is an experimental PyTorch re-implementation of DiBS: Differentiable Bayesian Structure Learning for differentiable Bayesian causal discovery.
The JAX reference code (~4 k LOC, mixed model + inference) is flattened here into two Python files so it is easier to iterate, debug, and eventually grow into a modular library:

file	role	key objects / functions
models/dibs_torch_v2.py	Core model + maths (≈1.1 k LOC)	scores, gumbel_soft_gmat, acyclic_constr, log_full_likelihood, log_joint, grad_log_joint …
tests/test_inference.py	Smoke-test & playground (≈350 LOC)	Generates a 3-node chain X1→X2→X3, runs plain gradient ascent for 100 steps, logs diagnostics via Hydra

Everything else (Hydra config files, utils, notebooks) is scaffolding.
SVGD, multi-particle inference and advanced DAG-penalty variants are not yet ported – the current loop is deliberately simple so we can validate gradients, clipping, annealing, etc.

Z latent ([D, K, 2]) encodes per-edge logits with the Innvae / Fortuin u–v factorisation (Eq. 9 in the paper).

θ is the (currently linear-SEM) weight matrix.

gumbel_soft_gmat() draws differentiable Gumbel-sigmoid edge samples; bernoulli_soft_gmat() produces element-wise probabilities.

acyclic_constr() implements the NOTEARS trace constraint h(G)=tr((I+αG)^d)-d. (Batch-aware patch included below.)

Annealing: update_dibs_hparams() rescales α and β each global step (t) with a warm-up factor so the DAG prior starts gentle and ramps up over time.

Ground truth:

X1   ~ N(0,1)
X2   = +2.0 · X1   + ε,  ε~N(0,σ²)
X3   = -1.5 · X2   + ε
Learning loop: 100 iterations of gradient ascent, step-sizes 0.005 for both Z and θ, gradient-norm clipping (11 and 19 by default).

Outcome: converges to the correct DAG within 50–70 iterations; coefficient estimates within ~10 % of ground truth.

3 . Known pain-points & open questions
🔧 Symptom	Likely cause	Mitigation ideas
Exploding θ gradients when true coefficients are large (≈10 or ≈-5).	Loss surface becomes stiff; Gaussian prior σ too small.	Either raise theta_prior_sigma or switch optimiser to Adam with per-parameter adaptivity; tune a “warm start” period for β.
Learnt graph cyclic for some initialisations.	DAG penalty zero-grad due to torch.bernoulli in gumbel_acyclic_constr_mc (non-diff).	Use soft Gumbel matrix inside h(G) (patch below).
trace dim-3 error beyond iter 80 (reported).	Batched graph input to acyclic_constr, but function assumed 2-D.	Add batch-aware trace (see patch).
Hydra config noise: many unused flags / comments.	Prototype still in flux.	Cull dead keys; move defaults into conf/config.yaml; add CI that runs pytest -q.


I have a messy code, the dibs_torch_clean is not as good as dibs_torch_v2.py(this is more accuarate)  and i dont get the same results in clean thats an issue,  the main 2 file is dibs_torch_v2.py and test_inference. i want to create a more structured code where i have defined utils, graph prior generated gorund truth (right now its the chain in test inference), the model and the test traning with a basic sgd recommend how i can structure this 


### **Current Implementation and Experiments**

- **PyTorch Implementation of DiBS:**
    - You have an initial, operational PyTorch implementation of the DiBS (Differentiable Bayesian Structure Learning) model running simple sg ascent.
    - This implementation is primarily designed for clarity in understanding how DiBS transitions from continuous latent spaces to discrete DAG representations.
    - *The current setup uses a simple li*near causal graph example (x1→x2→x3x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow x_3x1→x2→x3) to verify correctness.
- **Code Quality and Structure:**
    - Your current implementation is somewhat messy and could benefit from improved modularity and clarity.
    - You plan to refine this implementation for greater flexibility and readability, facilitating more complex extensions (e.g., nonlinearities, varied priors).

### **Immediate Next Steps**

- **Implement Graph Priors:**
    - Develop and integrate scale-free and Erdős-Rényi priors into existing PyTorch DiBS code.
    - Validate correctness using synthetic DAGs.
- **Nonlinear SCM Implementation:**
    - Define and integrate neural-network-based SCM functions.
    - Adapt likelihood and inference procedures accordingly.
- **Code Cleanup and Documentation:**
    - Restructure existing implementation for clarity and modularity.
    - Prepare for easy future extension and experimentation.


### **Upcoming Implementation Tasks**

### **1. Incorporation of Graph Priors**

You aim to introduce proper graph priors into the current DiBS implementation. Specifically, you are considering:

- **Scale-Free Priors:**
- **Erdős-Rényi Priors:**

### **2. Nonlinear Extensions**

- You plan to extend the DiBS model to nonlinear functional dependencies by:
    - Using neural networks (NN) for modeling conditional distributions.
    - Adjusting likelihood computations from linear Gaussian models to more general, nonlinear neural network-based models.

This involves significant modifications to:

- Likelihood computation.
- Neural network definition and training.
- Differentiable inference routines.
